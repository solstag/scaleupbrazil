immediate / next
----------------

* bug tracking system
  - add programmatic bug submission to certain errors -- look over and think about this...
  - keeping detailed notes
  - can't get email to work for now, but not a big deal
* router.py or something else
  - create jobs
  - start jobs

* ... (revisit code to download and evaluate results...)

* NEXT finish going through upload-files and prepare-images; now that the API handles uploading
  multipage pdf/tiff files, things may be quite a bit simpler...
* should extend the ThirdPartyClient and make our own with ability to upload, etc...
* REVISIT R code that figures out survey path based on questionnaire ID, etc
* AUDIT existing templates and figure out what to use...
* eventually, change harvest_scans so that it moves instead of copies

* add issue tracker (possibly roundup http://roundup-tracker.org/); for example, 
  when there are problems with scans, adjudication, etc...


micro
-----
* be sure that date/time stamps use UTC, not local time zones...
* be sure we can use the API to get a shred
* refine sibling templates into 15 (instead of 3) categories
* think more about cl interfact / interoperation btwn diffent scripts
  (eg image preprocessing / uploading / starting)
macro
-----

* look at updated captricity API for changes. in particular,
  it might be easier to create blank templates now...

* add exception handling throughout

* Getting captricity to read forms
** Getting pdfs/tiffs to turn into png (ale)
** Upload images and start a job (dennis)
** Understand the template-data dependencies
** Implement above dependencies to minimize co$ts

* Get processed data from captricity

* Resolve discrepancies between vargas and captricity
