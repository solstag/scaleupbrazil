----------------
* clearly define expected filetypes and only move scans that match;

micro
-----
* be sure that date/time stamps use UTC, not local time zones...
* be sure we can use the API to get a shred
* refine sibling templates into 15 (instead of 3) categories
* think more about cl interfact / interoperation btwn diffent scripts

* add exception handling throughout

* Getting captricity to read forms
** Getting pdfs/tiffs to turn into png (ale)
** Upload images and start a job (dennis)
** Understand the template-data dependencies
** Implement above dependencies to minimize co$ts
