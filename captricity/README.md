========================

This directory has scripts related to using Captricity to convert scanned survey forms into datasets for analysis.

The Captricity API token should be in a file in your home directory called:

~/.saudecoletiva/captricity-token

The scripts will look for the data under the directory:

~/.saudecoletiva/pngs

Do not include scanned forms in the repository as it wouldn't be appropriate to release them to the public.
