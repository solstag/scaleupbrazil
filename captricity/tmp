Dataset
	A dataset resource is a csv file containing the results of a processed job.

    <p>This is the same csv file as the one users of the site can download in the browse results page</p>

	Available methods:
		read_dataset(id)  -  Corresponding API call: GET to ^/api/shreddr/data-set/(?P<id>[\d]+)/$

Datasets
	A list of datasets associated with the selected job. [id] refers to the id attribute of the job resource.

	Available methods:
		read_datasets(id)  -  Corresponding API call: GET to ^/api/shreddr/job/(?P<id>[\d]+)/data-set/$

Document
	The document resource represents a blank template form (including each blank template page).

    <p>If you're looking for information on completed forms, look at Instance Sets.</p>

	Available methods:
		read_document(id)  -  Corresponding API call: GET to ^/api/shreddr/document/(?P<id>[\d]+)$
		update_document(id,{name})  -  Corresponding API call: PUT to ^/api/shreddr/document/(?P<id>[\d]+)$

Documents
	A list of document resources owned by the calling account.  See the document resource for an explanation of documents.

	Available methods:
		read_documents()  -  Corresponding API call: GET to ^/api/shreddr/document/$

Incomplete Instance Sets
	Returns all of the instance sets for the job specified by [id] that are missing
    completed form pages (instances).  A job cannot be submitted for processing
    unless all instance sets are complete.  See the iset_instances and
    iset_instance resources to upload missing pages.

	Available methods:
		read_incomplete_instance_sets(id)  -  Corresponding API call: GET to ^/api/shreddr/job/(?P<id>[\d]+)/incomplete-instance-set/$

Instance
	An instance is a completed form page.  If, for example, your
    form is a 3-page survey, an instance would be one filled-in page from
    a respondent.  This resource serves the metadata associated with an
    instance.  See the instance_aligned_image resource for the image data.

	Available methods:
		read_instance(id)  -  Corresponding API call: GET to ^/api/shreddr/instance/(?P<id>[\d]+)$

Instance Aligned Image
	This serves the image data associated with an instance. The image is
    post-processing: the original instance is first aligned to the template
    (sheet) image and then any fields marked as sensitive are redacted.  This
    image is only guaranteed to be available if the instance property
    alignment_succeeded is true.

	Available methods:
		read_instance_aligned_image(id)  -  Corresponding API call: GET to ^/api/shreddr/instance/(?P<id>[\d]+)/aligned-image$

Instance Set
	An instance set is a completed form that maps to a job's blank template
    form (document).  For example, if your job's form is a two page survey,
    then a complete instance set would have 2 associated instances: a complated page 1 and a
    completed page 2 (both from the same respondent).

    <p>A complete instance set will have the same number of completed pages
    (instances) as the job's blank template form has pages (sheets).  To add or remove
    filled-in pages, see the iset_instances and iset_instance resource.</p>

	Available methods:
		delete_instance_set(id)  -  Corresponding API call: DELETE to ^/api/shreddr/instance-set/(?P<id>[\d]+)$
		read_instance_set(id)  -  Corresponding API call: GET to ^/api/shreddr/instance-set/(?P<id>[\d]+)$

Instance Sets
	An instance set is a set of the filled-in pages (instances) slated to be
    digitized in the job specified by [id].  A POST to this resource will create a new
    empty instance set associated with the job.  See instance_set resource for
    more details.

	Available methods:
		create_instance_sets(id,{name,extra_pages_settings})  -  Corresponding API call: POST to ^/api/shreddr/job/(?P<id>[\d]+)/instance-set/$
		read_instance_sets(id)  -  Corresponding API call: GET to ^/api/shreddr/job/(?P<id>[\d]+)/instance-set/$

Iset Instance
	This resource allows you to manipulate the completed pages (instances)
    associated with the instance set specified by [id] according to their zero-indexed
    [page] number.  If the blank template form associated with this instance set's job is 2
    pages, you are allowed to read and update pages 0 and 1 on this
    instance set.

    <ul>

    <li> A GET of [iset] and [page] will return the JSON of the instance
    associated with that [page] of the instance set.</li>

    <li> A POST or PUT to [iset] and [page] will create or update the instance
    corresponding to this instance set's [page].  Note: if you are creating a
    new instance, both an image AND an image_name are required.</li>

    <li> A DELETE to [iset] and [page] will delete the instance corresponding
    to this instance set's [page].</li>

    </ul>

    You can also manipulate instances using their ID.  See the instance resource.

	Available methods:
		create_iset_instance(id,page,{image,image_name})  -  Corresponding API call: POST to ^/api/shreddr/instance-set/(?P<id>[\d]+)/page/(?P<page>[\d]+)$
		delete_iset_instance(id,page)  -  Corresponding API call: DELETE to ^/api/shreddr/instance-set/(?P<id>[\d]+)/page/(?P<page>[\d]+)$
		read_iset_instance(id,page)  -  Corresponding API call: GET to ^/api/shreddr/instance-set/(?P<id>[\d]+)/page/(?P<page>[\d]+)$
		update_iset_instance(id,page,{image,image_name})  -  Corresponding API call: PUT to ^/api/shreddr/instance-set/(?P<id>[\d]+)/page/(?P<page>[\d]+)$

Iset Instances

    instance set.  For more information, see the iset_instance and instance
    resource.

	Available methods:

Job
	A job resource links all of the information needed to run a set of completed forms through data entry.

    <p>Jobs pull together these resources:</>
    <ul>
        <li>A document which holds the blank template form images and all of the field definitions</li>
        <li>The completed form scans which are stored in instance sets.</li>
        <li>After the job has been processed, the resulting data sets.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Users of Captricity manage jobs to setup, pay for, and run a set of completed forms through data entry.</p>

    See the document resource for more details.

	Available methods:
		read_sheet_image(id)  -  Corresponding API call: GET to ^/api/shreddr/sheet/(?P<id>[\d]+)/image$

Sheet Thumbnail
	This serves a thumbnail image associated with the sheet specified by [id].
    The [size] parameter is expected to be number
    corresponding the desired width in pixels followed by a lowercase 'w'. By
    default, the following thumbnail sizes are available:

    <ul>
    <li>100 pixels wide (100w)</li>
    <li>300 pixels wide (300w)</li>
    <li>590 pixels wide (590w)</li>
    </ul>

    Non-default thumbnail sizes will be queued for creation on demand.  If a
    thumbnail is in the process of being created but is not available, this resource
    returns HTTP status code 202.  If the sheet is not found or there was
    a problem creating the thumbnail, this function will return HTTP status
    code 404.

	Available methods:
