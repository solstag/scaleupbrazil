Notes for captricity
====================

This file will keep track of some of our comments about Captricity and the Captricity API, in case they find them useful.

* there doesn't seem to be an easy way to see all of the documents/templates that we've created. for example, when browsing a completed job, it would be useful to be able to see and copy / edit the template that was used to create the data from the job. (this might be possible now, but it's not clear how.)
* more generally, for API users, it would be useful to create templates even if they aren't associated with any particular job. I believe we created a template that got deleted when the only job it was affiliated with was also deleted.
