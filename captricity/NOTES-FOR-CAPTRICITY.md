Notes for captricity
====================

This file will keep track of some of our comments about Captricity and the Captricity API, in case they find them useful.

* there doesn't seem to be an easy way to see all of the documents/templates that we've created. for example, when browsing a completed job, it would be useful to be able to see and copy / edit the template that was used to create the data from the job. (this might be possible now, but it's not clear how.)

* more generally, for API users, it would be useful to create templates even if they aren't associated with any particular job. I believe we created a template that got deleted when the only job it was affiliated with was also deleted.

* starting a job via the API doesn't seem to have generated an email. it would be nice to have this as an option (sometimes you might want it, and sometimes not)

* the API doesn't appear to expose the ability to know the costs of a job that will be submitted. also, it would be nice to be able to query how much money is left in the account, eg, so that we can check whether or not it's time to top up.
